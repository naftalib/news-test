I used this project as the playground to get familiar with and perfect using hooks in functional based components. I coded the project up from scratch with hooks and then recoded it into a class-based one and then redid it as functinal so as to fully grasp the mechanics of using the 'useState' and 'useEffect' hooks.

The app initializes with an API call to the hacker news site and returns the titles of the entered serach query which is defaulte to serach for any posts on react. 
Search freely and see what titles come up!
